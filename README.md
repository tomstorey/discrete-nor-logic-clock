# Discrete NOR logic clock

This repository will contains design files for a project I am working on to build a clock (and calendar) out of discrete transistor NOR logic.

I have a blog covering the design and build details at [ornotblog.blogspot.com](https://ornotblog.blogspot.com).

If you want to contribute you can do so by:
- leaving a comment on the blog (see above) - preferred for general discussion of the project
- opening an issue here - preferred for issues, suggestions, or corrections specific to design files themselves

This repository contains design files for a project I completed, which was to build a clock (and calendar) solely out of discrete transistor NOR logic.

I have a blog which covers the design and build details at [ornotblog.blogspot.com](https://ornotblog.blogspot.com).

The project took approximately 5-6 months to complete between March and September in 2017.

Although the project is now complete, please feel free to send comments, suggestions, or highlight any design issues that you find. I am  very interested to hear what people think, and/or learn something, and fixes can still be incorporated in to the schematics for others to benefit from!

# 7 segment decoders

Here you will find designs for 3 different 7 segment decoders:

* 2 bit decoder for displaying 0-3
* 3 bit decoder for displaying 0-7
* 4 bit decoder which will display 0-9, with blank display for values 10-15

The design of these decoders is covered in a blog post here: [Clock design notes #2 - 7 segment decoders](https://ornotblog.blogspot.co.uk/2017/03/clock-design-notes-2-7-segment-decoders.html)

The files ending with Rev B are a re-designed version of the originals. They either use less gates/transistors to implement their functionality and/or decode fewer digits. They were introduced in the following blog post: [Clock design log #3 - time decoders](https://ornotblog.blogspot.co.uk/2017/05/clock-design-log-3-time-decoders.html)

The .logicly files can be opened using software from <http://logic.ly>.
